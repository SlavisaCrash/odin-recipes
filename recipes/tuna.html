    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>This was a favorite in my home growing up and now it's a favorite of my family 
        as well. I double the recipe these days for my husband and three children. 
        For a change of pace I add canned chopped green chilies and 1/8 teaspoon 
        cayenne, use pasta shells or spirals, or top the casserole with sliced 
        American or cheddar cheese instead of breadcrumbs.
    </p>

    <h2>Ingredients</h2>

        <li>1 (12 ounce) package egg noodles</li>

        <li>1 (5 ounce) can tuna, drained</li>
